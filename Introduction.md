# What is MwM? #

MwM started out as an exercise in learning WPF, MVVM, and new features of .NET 4.0. Originally, it was just a test bench to apply concepts learned during a training course. From there, it has begun to grow into a more feature-rich class library for WPF and .NET 4.0 development.


# Where is MwM going? #

From it's humble roots, MwM is striving to become a feature-rich toolkit and class library that can be used my .NET developers in a variety of applications. The main goals are:

  1. Provide a framework for using MVVM.
  1. Fill in the gaps that still exist in WPF, in particular Markup Extensions and Type Converters.
  1. Provide out-of-the-box implementations for common programming tasks.
